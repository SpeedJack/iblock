\begin{abstract}
	Since the Bitcoin's release in 2009, numerous cryptocurrencies and
	blockchain-based technologies have emerged, each requiring careful
	consideration of performance and security issues.

	This work introduces \iblock{}, a comprehensive \omnetpp{} library and
	simulation model for the Bitcoin protocol, enabling simulations across
	various layers of a Bitcoin network (network, consensus, incentives,
	data).

	Designed for \omnetpp{}, \iblock{} enables detailed network-layer
	simulations, while its in-depth representation of Bitcoin's data
	structures and algorithms facilitates experiments across consensus,
	incentive mechanisms and data management. \iblock{} modular and
	extensible architecture allows for the seamless addition of new
	features and behaviors, providing a valuable framework for studying
	their effects on the Bitcoin network.

	We benchmark \iblock{}'s features and performance against other
	blockchain simulators, validate its accuracy by comparing simulation
	results with related studies and real Bitcoin network data, and
	showcase \iblock{}'s capability to simulate different scenarios.
	Finally, we discuss \iblock{}'s limitations and potential areas for
	future development.
