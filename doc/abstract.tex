\begin{abstract}
	Since the Bitcoin's release in 2009, numerous cryptocurrencies and
	blockchain-based technologies have emerged, each requiring careful
	consideration of performance and security issues.

	This work introduces \iblock{}, a comprehensive C++ library and
	simulation model for the Bitcoin protocol, enabling simulations across
	various layers of a Bitcoin network (network, consensus, incentives,
	data).

	Designed for \omnetpp{}, \iblock{} enables detailed network-layer
	simulations, while its in-depth representation of Bitcoin's data
	structures and algorithms facilitates experiments across consensus,
	incentive mechanisms and data management. The integration with other
	\omnetpp{} libraries allows even more detailed simulations. \iblock{}
	modular and extensible architecture allows for the seamless addition of
	new features and behaviors, providing a valuable framework for studying
	their effects on the Bitcoin network.

	We benchmark \iblock{}'s features and performance against other
	blockchain simulators, proving that \iblock{} is more efficient than
	other state-of-the-art simulators, validate its accuracy by comparing
	simulation results with related studies and real Bitcoin network data,
	and showcase \iblock{}'s capability to simulate different scenarios
	such as the selfish mining attack. Finally, we discuss \iblock{}'s
	limitations and potential areas for future development.
