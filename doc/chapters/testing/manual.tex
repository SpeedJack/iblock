\section{Manual Verification}\label{sec:manual-verification}

The \texttt{SimpleTest} configuration was used to conduct detailed manual
checks on the model. This configuration features a small network of three
nodes, including one miner node. Each node generates transactions at a rate of
one transaction per minute, providing a simplified environment for focused
inspection.

A graphical test was performed within the \omnetpp{}'s QT environment, enabling
a visual review of network behavior. This test allowed for real-time
observation of interactions, confirming that nodes communicated and processed
messages as expected. Additionally, the model was run step-by-step under a
debugger to closely examine the logic and data flow, ensuring each component
operated as intended and followed the correct sequence of operations.

The \omnetpp's event trace log was generated and analyzed to verify the
scheduling of events, confirming that they occurred in the expected order and
timeline. This careful, multi-faceted approach provided a thorough assessment
of the model's core workflow, confirming that fundamental functions and data
pathways were correctly implemented.
