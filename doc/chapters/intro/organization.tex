\section{Organization of this Work}\label{sec:organization}

\chref{ch:background} describes the Bitcoin system, illustrates the \omnetpp{}
simulation framework, and reviews the state-of-the-art in blockchain simulation
discussing some available simulators.

\chref{ch:implementation} details the design and implementation of \iblock{}.

\chref{ch:testing} outlines the test conducted to verify and validate the
simulator.

\chref{ch:performance} examines optimizations applied to \iblock{} and
evaluates its performance in terms of speed and memory usage, comparing it
with another simulator.

\chref{ch:pocs} showcases some proofs of concept implemented with \iblock{}
and provides some examples of analyses achievable with the simulator.

\chref{ch:next} discusses the limitations of the current \iblock{}
implementation and proposes areas for future enhancement.

\chref{ch:conclusions} concludes the thesis with final remarks, while
\appendixref{appendix:math} contains mathematical computations for estimating
the time required to mine a new Bitcoin block and the formulas for the
network's difficulty adjustments.
