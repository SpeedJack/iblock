\section{OMNeT++}\label{sec:omnetpp}

\omnetpp{} is an extensible, modular, component-based C++ simulation library
and framework, primarily for building network simulators
\cite{omnetpp-simulation-manual}. \omnetpp{} is public-source and can be freely
used under the Academic Public License for non-profit purposes. The framework
is designed to enable large-scale simulations with hierarchical models,
facilitate the visualization and debugging of simulation models, allow the
development of modular and customizable models, and provide instrumentation to
analyze simulation results \cite{omnetpp}.

It features a topology description language called NED to define the structure
of the model and the network topology, leveraging common object-oriented
features such as inheritance and interfaces.

Starting from the user-provided C++ model, \omnetpp{} generates an executable
that embeds the simulation model and the \omnetpp{}'s simulation kernel. The
architecture of an \omnetpp{} model is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:omnetpp-architecture}.

	Simulation Kernel is responsible for the execution of the simulation
	and event scheduling. Different user interfaces can be used to monitor
	the execution.}\label{fig:omnetpp-architecture}
