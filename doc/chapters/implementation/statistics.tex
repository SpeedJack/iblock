\section{Collected Statistics}\label{sec:statistics}

During simulation, \iblock{} collects a range of statistics using \omnetpp{}'s
signal mechanism. In this approach, simulation modules emit signals, which
\omnetpp{} collects according to the NED file specifications.

Most statistics are gathered on a per-node basis, reflecting the decentralized
nature of a Bitcoin network. This structure means that the number of potential
statistics grows linearly with the number of nodes, though users can configure
simulations to focus only on specific statistics of interest.

Statistics can be collected as time series (vectors), aggregated values
(scalars), or histograms, depending on the needs of the analysis.

Table~\ref{tab:network-statistics} provides an overview of network-level
statistics tracked by \iblock{}, while Table~\ref{tab:node-statistics} on
page~\pageref{tab:node-statistics} details the node-level statistics collected.
