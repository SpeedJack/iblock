\chapter{Implementation}\label{ch:implementation}

This chapter describes the design and implementation of \iblock{}, following a
top-down approach. First, an overview of the system design is presented, then
the implementation of the system components is described in detail. In
\secref{sec:impl-objects}, a description of the data model used to represent
Bitcoin blocks and transactions is provided. Finally, \secref{sec:impl-global}
provides an overview of the global modules that are used to manage the system
at the network level and \secref{sec:statistics} describes the statistics that
are collected by the system.
